# AWP Practicals 2024 - Advanced Web Programming Codes

Welcome to the **Advanced Web Programming (AWP) Practicals** repository for 2024. This repository contains practical solutions for **C#** and **ASP.NET** assignments from an Advanced Web Programming course. Each solution demonstrates key concepts in C# and ASP.NET, covering topics such as web forms, validation controls, database integration, and data binding.

## Repository Contents

This repository is structured by practical numbers and includes the following:

### 1. Basic C# and ASP.NET Applications
- Create an application to compute the product of four integers.
- Demonstrate string operations in C#.
- Implement a simple student information entry and display system.
- Perform operations like Fibonacci series generation, prime number testing, and vowel detection.

### 2. Object-Oriented C# and ASP.NET
- Perform factorial calculations, currency conversions, and quadratic equation solving.
- Demonstrate function overloading, inheritance, constructor overloading, interfaces, and exception handling.

### 3. Web Forms and Server Controls
- Create a web page with server controls like AutoPostBack, Calendar control, and TreeView control.
- Implement a registration form using validation controls and AdRotator control.

### 4. ASP.NET Navigation, Master Pages, and States
- Build a web application using website navigation controls and site maps.
- Demonstrate the use of master pages and themes for page styling and beautification.
- Handle and demonstrate various states of ASP.NET pages.

### 5. Database Operations in ASP.NET
- Create web applications that perform database queries and display data in forms, dropdown lists, and textboxes.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using SQL and ExecuteNonQuery.

### 6. Data Controls and GridView
- Demonstrate data binding using `SqlDataSource`, `DetailsView`, `FormView`, and `GridView` controls.
- Show disconnected data access in ASP.NET.
